## Active state (2026-04-29)

- **Dual-robot Nav2 MPPI migration + brake bug + stuck-watchdog + TF chain (2026-04-29)** — three-day journey from "A\* still scuffs" through "MPPI works but wheels won't brake" to "two robots navigate independently with self-recovery". Root-cause work, not band-aids — every fix is one of: a real bug in a vendored library, a misconfigured footprint, or a missing escape valve. Detailed write-up in [docs/claude/nav2_mppi_journey.md](docs/claude/nav2_mppi_journey.md). Headline:
  1. **Why A\* was retired (and why FAR + safety-stack 2026-04-26 also fell short for the dual-robot case)** — A\*'s 2D footprint was the original sin; the 3-layer FAR safety stack from 2026-04-26 stabilised but didn't eliminate scuffs, and any tuning round that tightened one layer (CFPA2 pivot-lock, path_safety_filter, cmd_vel_safety_shield) tended to deadlock with another. Switched both robots to **Nav2 MPPI + SmacPlannerHybrid** — battle-tested upstream code, Reeds-Shepp planning + velocity-space sampling, single source of truth for footprint geometry.
  2. **MPPI footprint trap** — `consider_footprint: false` + `robot_radius: 0.40` gave MPPI an *effective* rejection radius of `0.40 + collision_margin (0.20) = 0.60 m`. demo3_mixed has a **0.425 m** narrow corridor — MPPI permanently rejected forward velocities → robot "stamped in place". Fix: `footprint: "[[0.35,0.20], …]"` (rectangle) + `consider_footprint: true` + `collision_margin_distance: 0.03`. The earlier yaml comment claiming `consider_footprint=true` *throws at configure-time* on humble 1.1.20 turned out to be wrong — the throw was a **polygon-string parse error** when the yaml had only `robot_radius:`. With both costmaps using `footprint:` polygons, MPPI accepts `consider_footprint=true` cleanly. Created twin yamls: [`nav2_go2w_full_stack.yaml`](src/go2w/go2w_config/config/nav/nav2_go2w_full_stack.yaml) (0.70 × 0.40 m, vx_max 0.50, min_turning 0.30) and [`nav2_go2_full_stack.yaml`](src/go2w/go2w_config/config/nav/nav2_go2_full_stack.yaml) (0.65 × 0.30 m, vx_max 0.30, min_turning 0.05 for in-place pivot).
  3. **The brake bug — vendored mujoco_ros2_control had a real ctrl-cache bug** — bag analysis: `wheel_cmd: 0.000` published, but `joint_states.velocity[FL_foot_joint] ≈ 4-5 rad/s` for several seconds despite no commands. Spent half a day mis-locating it (router event-driven publish; wheel actuator type `<velocity>` → `<motor>` + PID; sim slowdown 25× from the actuator change). **Real cause** was [`mujoco_system.cpp:466-470`](src/vendor/mujoco_ros2_control/mujoco_ros2_control/src/mujoco_system.cpp#L466-L470): the VELOCITY actuator branch wrote `mujoco_data_->ctrl[…] = velocity` only when `velocity != joint.last_command`, but **never updated `last_command`** (POSITION branch did, EFFORT path was a no-op). Once `velocity == initial last_command (~0)`, ctrl was never refreshed → stuck at the previous non-zero setpoint. **2-line fix**: add `joint.last_command = velocity;` inside the conditional + NaN-init the struct field. After the fix: cmd 5 rad/s → wheels reach 5; cmd 0 → wheels decelerate to ~0.7 rad/s in 3s under residual ground-friction-and-body-drag dynamics. RT factor 0.99×.
  4. **Freewheel-in-legged** — with the brake fixed, legged mode (CHAMP walking) was *worse* than before because the velocity actuator now actually applied 15 N·m brake torque opposing the body's residual motion. Wheels skidded against the ground while CHAMP walked. Fix: in [`go2w_hybrid_cmd_router.py`](src/go2w/go2w_control/scripts/go2w_hybrid_cmd_router.py), subscribe to joint_states and in legged/idle mode publish `wheel_cmd = current_actual_ω` (mirror); error→0, no torque, wheels passively roll. Verified: in legged mode FL ω +0.39 rad/s, FL cmd +0.44 rad/s, diff 0.05 rad/s → ~2 N·m residual brake (vs the previous ~15 N·m).
  5. **CFPA2 frontier filters mirror the footprint** — once the polygon footprint shrank effective rejection from 0.60 → ~0.23 m, robot_a navigated successfully into demo3 narrow geometry — but immediately hit `fronts=0 → exploration_complete` at 79.5 % cov with 153k unknown cells still on the map. CFPA2 was filtering them all out. Live-probe of `/merged_map`: 167 valid frontier cells exist, but the largest cluster is 0.15 m². The default `cfpa2_frontier_min_cluster_area_m2: 0.20` rejected every cluster. Lowered to **0.05 m²**; also dropped `cfpa2_frontier_obstacle_clearance_m` 0.40 → **0.25 m** and `cfpa2_frontier_unknown_check_radius_m` 0.40 → **0.30 m** — these were calibrated to the old 0.40 m circle and shut out frontiers in narrow geometry exactly the same way MPPI did. **Lesson: footprint changes ripple through every distance-style threshold in CFPA2; treat them as a coupled set.** Live-tuning via `ros2 param set` does **not** work — CFPA2 has no `add_on_set_parameters_callback`, so cached values stay frozen; must edit yaml + restart the node.
  6. **SLAM drift mystery, properly resolved** — observed ~10 m offset between MuJoCo GT and `/robot_a/odom/nav`. Initial guess (mine *and* the user's): SC-PGO false-positive loop closure. **Wrong** — `/corrected_odom` had **0 publishers**; SC-PGO was never running (`nav_test_mujoco_fastlio.launch.py` hardcodes paths to `/home/hz/COMP0225_LRC_stack/...` from a previous developer's machine, *silent-skipped* on this machine for months). Real cause: pure Fast-LIO 2 ICP scan-matching drift, accumulated open-loop. Map looks **clean** (octomap uses Fast-LIO's own TF, so walls + robot pose are projected with the same drifted estimate → relative geometry preserved → no ghosting). User's keen observation: "**the map is clean, only the trajectory is messy**" — exactly right; the trajectory is drawn from `/odom/nav` (drifted) while the map is drawn from Fast-LIO TF (self-consistent). This is the **co-drift property of LIO**: as long as the SLAM frame is internally consistent, the robot navigates correctly even with absolute-frame drift, because all decisions are relative-geometry.
  7. **`loop_closure:=true|false` toggle scaffolded** — vendored `engcang/FAST-LIO-SAM` to [`src/vendor/sc_pgo/`](src/vendor/sc_pgo/) (ROS 1 source, `COLCON_IGNORE` in place); added a `loop_closure` launch arg that, when true, attempts to spawn `sc_pgo_node` per-namespace and `slam_odom_relay` prefers `/corrected_odom`. Currently the toggle warn-skips silently because the source needs ROS 2 humble porting (catkin → ament_cmake + API translation per [`PORT_TO_ROS2.md`](src/vendor/sc_pgo/PORT_TO_ROS2.md)). Future-compatible knob: once SC-PGO ports cleanly, flip the flag to engage drift correction.
  8. **stuck_watchdog: outer-loop self-recovery** — MPPI in narrow-pivot scenarios outputs (v ≈ 0, ω ≈ 0) **without ever reporting failure**, so Nav2's BT recovery sequence (Backup / Spin / Wait) never fires. CFPA2's pivot-lock additionally refuses to change goal while clearance disk < 0.45 m, with a `pivot_lock_max_hold_sec: 15.0` parameter that's *declared* in source but **never actually used** (dead param) — robot_a was wedged for 220 s before the user noticed. Wrote [`scripts/runtime/stuck_watchdog.py`](scripts/runtime/stuck_watchdog.py) (~250 lines): subscribes odom + goal_pose, fires a Nav2 **BackUp action** when no-motion-with-active-goal exceeds 10 s, then republishes the goal to force SmacHybrid to replan from the new (post-backup) pose. Per-namespace, real-robot-compatible (uses Nav2's existing behavior_server). Verified: `STUCK detected → BackUp accepted → BackUp finished → goal republished` chain executes. **Caveat**: BackUp itself collision-checks the rear path with `simulate_ahead_time × backup_speed = 0.20 m`, so a robot wedged with walls on both sides gets `Collision Ahead - Exiting DriveOnHeading`. Last-resort raw-cmd_vel pulse not yet wired.
  9. **Brace yourself: TF chain + CHAMP state_estimation are the real-robot blockers** — current sim tree: `world → map → odom → base_link`, with `map → odom` static identity (no SLAM correction layer) and `odom → base_link` written by **`mujoco_odom_bridge`** directly from MuJoCo's pose sensor (sim-only privilege). On real, that bridge doesn't exist, so `odom → base_link` would have to come from the EKF chain (`footprint_to_odom_ekf` ← `/robot_a/odom/raw` + `/imu/data`). But `/robot_a/odom/raw` from CHAMP's `state_estimation_node` is publishing **`x: 7.802912350277346e+34`** — fully bonkers value, NaN-class. EKF starves on that input → no `/robot_a/odom`, no TF written → on real the entire `odom → base_link` chain breaks → Nav2 has no robot pose. Independent of SLAM. Sim hides this because mujoco_odom_bridge writes the canonical TF from GT, bypassing the EKF entirely. **Pragmatic real-robot fix is to drop the EKF + leg-odom path and have Fast-LIO publish `map → base_link` directly** (Fast-LIO uses lidar + IMU, doesn't need leg odom — its own output `/robot_a/Odometry` is fine, just hardcoded to frame `camera_init → body` so a TF adapter is needed to remap). Not yet done.
  10. **`/odom/nav` was shared by 6 consumers, each making decisions on a frame that's 6.4 m off from TF** — cfpa2_coordinator (frontier utility distance), bt_navigator (both robots), cfpa2_to_nav2_bridge (orientation synthesis), stuck_watchdog. None matched what SmacHybrid saw via TF. User spotted this directly: "the plan starts from the robot's actual position, but the marker is somewhere else" — confirmed two pose sources. **Resolved 2026-04-29**: wrote [`scripts/runtime/fast_lio_tf_adapter.py`](scripts/runtime/fast_lio_tf_adapter.py) (~250 lines) — subscribes Fast-LIO's `/<ns>/Odometry`, optionally GT-bootstraps once at startup so map frame's origin = world origin, then publishes the same pose via TF (`odom → base_link` with `/tf` remapped to `/<ns>/tf`) AND the topic `/<ns>/odom/nav`. Replaced `slam_odom_relay` (the legacy frame-remap-only relay) and disabled `mujoco_odom_bridge`'s `publish_tf` (sim-only privilege that competed with the adapter). Verified post-fix: GT (+10.517, +1.952) ≈ /odom/nav (+10.503, +2.027) ≈ TF odom→base_link (+10.503, +2.027) — all within 8 cm. Real-robot compatible: same code path, no MuJoCo dependency. With SC-PGO ported, adapter automatically prefers `/<ns>/corrected_odom` when fresh.
  11. **`/odom/nav` rate: 10 Hz** — adapter is 1:1 relay, follows Fast-LIO's lidar-rate output. Adequate for current stack (MPPI controller 20 Hz × `transform_tolerance: 0.2s` gives ~4 frames of TF buffer; planner re-plans at 1 Hz; CFPA2 ticks 2 Hz; stuck_watchdog window is 10 s = 100 samples). If real-robot cmd_vel ever shows oscillation or "Control loop missed rate" warns persistently, options are (a) modify Fast-LIO source to publish at IMU-propagation rate (~200 Hz between scans), or (b) add an IMU-only EKF for `odom → base_link` at 200 Hz and have the adapter publish `map → odom` for SLAM correction (proper REP-105 split). Neither needed yet.
  12. **CHAMP state_estimation `7.8e+34` bug — bypassed, not fixed**. With the adapter owning the TF chain, `footprint_to_odom_ekf` is no longer in the pose-publishing path. EKFs continue to spawn (they're started in `build_dual_robot_stack` for legacy reasons) but produce no output (starved on the NaN); harmless. Real-robot deployment no longer blocked by CHAMP's broken leg-odom — the only remaining real-robot blocker is **SC-PGO drift correction** (Fast-LIO will accumulate ~10 m / 7 min open-loop, which is fine if the run stays self-consistent — see "co-drift property" — but degrades absolute-coordinate handoffs and cross-robot map fusion).

  Net result: dual-robot Nav2 MPPI sim works end-to-end (both robots independently navigate demo3_mixed, CFPA2 allocates frontiers, ~0–2 contacts per run, RT 0.99 ×). **Sim and real now share the same TF / odom data path** — no more sim-only privileges (mujoco_odom_bridge writes a GT *topic* for collision_monitor, but **no longer writes TF**). The only remaining real-robot gap is loop-closure drift correction (SC-PGO port).

## Active state (2026-04-26)

- **Dual-robot FAR migration + 3-tier safety stack (2026-04-26)** — A\* abandoned for dual-robot use; FAR + CFPA2 became the production stack. A\*'s 2D footprint check accumulated band-aids (pivot-relief, body-clip escape, head footprint extension, brake-priority, fast-BL debounce, …) without solving the core 2D-blindness — pillars at z<0.20m, head-tip extension, leg-swing envelope, all kept producing scuffs. FAR's terrain_analysis (3D voxel) sees those obstacles correctly. **However FAR has its own weaknesses** — V-graph topology occasionally connects two contour vertices through walls (sparse contour sampling, `terrain_free_Z` thresholds, sensor-range edge effects) and pathFollower can rotate body-into-wall when held goal demands an unsafe pivot. Three execution-time safety layers were added on top:
  1. **CFPA2 pivot-lock** ([cfpa2_coordinator_node.py](src/collaborative_exploration/cfpa2_collaborative_autonomy/cfpa2_collaborative_autonomy/cfpa2_coordinator_node.py)) — refuses goal *changes* while clearance disk < `pivot_lock_radius_m` (0.45m). Blocks B's "玄关" failure mode where new goal demands rotation B can't perform.
  2. **path_safety_filter** ([path_safety_filter.py](src/go2w/go2w_nav/scripts/path_safety_filter.py)) — between localPlanner and pathFollower; rejects/truncates path if any future pose's footprint disk intersects an occupied /map cell. Catches FAR V-graph "path through wall" topology errors. Falls back to `base_link` when CMU's `vehicle` frame isn't connected to the SLAM tree (it never is by default — added a `base_link → vehicle` static bridge in mixed.launch).
  3. **cmd_vel_safety_shield** ([cmd_vel_safety_shield.py](src/go2w/go2w_nav/scripts/cmd_vel_safety_shield.py)) — between pathFollower and twist_bridge; **predictive** oriented-footprint check on requested ω over `predict_horizon_sec=0.4`s. Kills ω only if rotated body would clip; preserves ω that rotates *away* from walls. Preserves linear so robot can drive out of corridor.
  Trade-off: each layer can stack with the others into a deadlock (B stuck, A spinning) — needs `pivot_lock_max_hold_sec` escape valve and careful tuning of disk radii. Filter+shield CRITICALLY require `/tf → /{ns}/tf` remap; without it, lookups silently fail and they passthrough every frame (a real-world failure mode that took an afternoon to spot via filter status JSON).
  Tuning highlights: `voxel_dim 0.10→0.05` (V-graph contour density 2×), `terrain_free_Z 0.15→0.05` (catches wall bases at lidar grazing angle), `obstacleHeightThre 0.20→0.02` (localPlanner sees ground-level wall edges), `useCost: True / costScore 0.10` (path-candidate clearance preference), `pointPerPathThre 2→1` (sparse far-wall hits still block path), `peer_filter_radius_m 0.80→1.20` (asymmetric self-filter drops A=0/scan vs B=217/scan was caused by `peer_pose_stale_sec=0.3` rejecting peer odom on sim_time/wall_time stamp mismatch — bumped to 5.0). RViz `LocalPath` display fixed to subscribe `/{ns}/local_path` (filter output) instead of legacy `/{ns}/path` (no longer published after remap chain). The FAR `way_point_marker` is misleading (always a straight line through walls — it's FAR's *intent*, not the executed path) — disabled by default in nav_test_mixed.rviz.
  Honest assessment: even with the 3 layers, dual-robot demo3_mixed isn't 100% scuff-free (B玄关-spawn corner geometry forces leg brushes; A-FAR V-graph edge cases through divider walls remain). Score stabilises around 0-2 leg-scuff events per run with 0 wall-climbs, 0 tip-overs, 70-79% coverage. Pillar-grade obstacles below octomap's `point_cloud_min_z=0.20` are still invisible to /map; only terrain_analysis (which feeds FAR) sees them. Real-robot config (`real_single.launch.py nav=far`) already wires the full CMU stack with terrain_analysis at `obstacleHeightThre=0.50` (noise-tolerant) and `twoWayDrive=False`; the new safety layers are sim-only for now (need TF/topic-name port).
- **Nav planner cleanup + A\* planner shipped (2026-04-24)** — deleted `reactive_nav_node` (RRT\*) and `mppi_nav_node` after A* matched their capability on demo3. Three nav backends remain: **`astar`** (new C++ A* + pure-pursuit + Stanley + curvature speed shaping + Option B oriented footprint validation), `default` (Python A*/D* Lite, real-robot + door task baseline), `far` (CMU stack). Door task migrated reactive_nav_door.yaml → astar_nav_door.yaml. Heterogeneous dual launch now supports `nav_backend_a:=astar nav_backend_b:=far` — hybrid_cmd_router's `wheel_command_topic` is absolute `/mujoco_sim/{ns}_wheel_velocity_controller/commands` (latent mixed-launch bug: relative path under `/{ns}` never reached the controller under `/mujoco_sim/controller_manager` — FAR masked it because cmd_vel was too smooth to trigger wheel mode; A* exposed it). Back-compat aliases in every launch: `reactive→default`, `rrt_star/far_rrt_star/mppi→astar`. **Note (2026-04-26): A\* was abandoned for dual-robot use after 2D footprint kept producing scuffs — see today's dual-robot FAR migration entry above.** → [docs/claude/nav_benchmarks.md](docs/claude/nav_benchmarks.md#a-star-planner-2026-04-24) | [docs/claude/door_task.md](docs/claude/door_task.md)
- **Door task** — Phase 3 VLM controller + Phase 0 refactor shipped. Analytical door-lock barrier verified end-to-end 2026-04-14. Button-gated collaborative protocol working. Next: re-capture 5-trial benchmark with full fix stack (now on astar backend). → [docs/claude/door_task.md](docs/claude/door_task.md)
- **Nav benchmarking** — Config A = 7/10 FULL PASS on demo1 (12×8 m). Fast-LIO2 + SC-PGO integrated, fixes scan-odom temporal lag; contact margins now the bottleneck. Next: stuck detector for corner-wedge 1/10 failure mode. → [docs/claude/nav_benchmarks.md](docs/claude/nav_benchmarks.md)
- **Go2 (non-W) integration** — **shipped** under CHAMP on `demo1_go2_real.xml` / `demo3_go2_real.xml` (Menagerie body). Exploration planner swapped from CFPA2 → **real CMU TARE** (vendored from `caochao39/tare_planner` humble-jazzy at `src/vendor/tare_planner/`). TARE feeds `localPlanner` **directly, bypassing FAR** — FAR's V-graph can't route to exploration frontiers; CMU's own TARE pipeline also skips FAR. Sensor-derived **waypoint watchdog** (2026-04-21) publishes to `/{ns}/nogo_boundary` as a persistent blacklist whenever TARE picks a goal the stack can't reach (4 fault modes: terrain-cluster, occgrid-occupied, out-of-grid, progress-stall); also republishes RViz markers the FAR-branch rviz expects. **Real-robot port shipped** as [`real_single_tare_real.launch.py`](src/go2w/go2w_real_bringup/launch/real_single_tare_real.launch.py) (`nav=tare_real`), plus `obstacle_avoidance:=false` gotcha: default `true` routes Move to `/api/obstacles_avoid/request` which requires pre-arming; `oa=false` routes to `/api/sport/request` (api_id=1008), no manual mode switch needed. **10-trial × 10-min demo3 bench** (2026-04-21): 10/10 completed, 10/10 zero contacts, 71 % avg coverage (σ = 5.4 %), 0/10 passed the 90 % bar — stack is robust; 10 min is a tight budget for 384 m² given CHAMP's 0.3 m/s cap × MuJoCo RTF ≈ 0.5. → [docs/claude/go2_integration.md](docs/claude/go2_integration.md)
- **Real-robot Fast-LIO path — shipped after 10-layer bug hunt (2026-04-17)**. Livox Mid-360 auto-detect at `192.168.123.20`, `livox_ros_driver2` + `Livox-SDK2` vendored (workspace-local install, no `/usr/local` pollution). Red TRIANGLE_LIST robot-pose marker, dual RViz (2D top-down + 3D voxel orbit), supervisor-panic any-button override, dry-run mode. Map **expands correctly on flat and ramped terrain**; `/robot/map` via octomap_server RANSAC ground filter, 3D voxel grid via `/robot/octomap_point_cloud_centers`. Mid-360 mount tilt (measured +15.1° pitch / -2.1° roll) compensated via two static TFs; gravity-aligned map frame. → [docs/claude/real_robot.md](docs/claude/real_robot.md#bug-chain-2026-04-17-map-doesnt-expand)

## Nav backends

Switchable via `nav_backend:=` / `nav_execution_backend:=` at launch time.

| Backend | Planner | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `nav2_mppi` | `nav2_planner` (SmacPlannerHybrid REEDS_SHEPP) + `nav2_controller` (MPPIController) + `nav2_behaviors` + `nav2_bt_navigator` + `nav2_lifecycle_manager` | Production stack for both robots (2026-04-29). Per-platform yaml: [`nav2_go2w_full_stack.yaml`](src/go2w/go2w_config/config/nav/nav2_go2w_full_stack.yaml) for Go2W, [`nav2_go2_full_stack.yaml`](src/go2w/go2w_config/config/nav/nav2_go2_full_stack.yaml) for Go2. Outer-loop `stuck_watchdog` per robot. CFPA2 `way_point` is bridged to `goal_pose` via `cfpa2_to_nav2_bridge`. |
| `astar` | `astar_nav_node` | C++ A* + pure-pursuit + Stanley + curvature speed shaping + oriented footprint validation (Option B). **Retired for dual-robot 2026-04-26**, fully superseded by nav2_mppi 2026-04-29; left in place for door-task baseline. |
| `default` | `default_nav.py` | Python A* grid + D* Lite + recovery; legacy stable for real robot + door task |
| `far` | CMU autonomy stack | Terrain analysis + FAR V-graph + path follower (see nav_benchmarks.md) |

Legacy aliases silently upgrade: `reactive` → `default`, `rrt_star` / `far_rrt_star` / `mppi` → `astar`. The reactive RRT* planner (`reactive_nav_node`) and MPPI (`mppi_nav_node`) were deleted 2026-04-24 once A* had matched their capabilities. Door task uses `astar` with `astar_nav_door.yaml` (aggressive obstacle thresholds for bumper contact).

## Golden rules (must-follow across all work)

1. **Always `use_sim_time: true`** for all nodes in MuJoCo or Gazebo. Mixed time domains corrupt maps.
2. **Never use stale TF fallback.** Drop the scan on TF failure; don't use `tf2::TimePointZero`.
3. **Each scan painted exactly once.** Clear `last_scan_` after processing in mappers.
4. **Dual-robot TF must be namespaced.** Remap `/tf` → `/{ns}/tf` for all nodes.
5. **DDS config matters.** `config/fastdds_no_shm.xml` disables shared memory for reliability. Real robot uses CycloneDDS.
6. **Verify with `ros2 topic hz`** after changing sensor rates. Xacro changes require model re-spawn.
7. **Kill zombie MuJoCo before re-launch** (see [debug_notes.md](docs/claude/debug_notes.md)).
8. **Benchmark PASS criterion** = `completed ∧ coverage≥90% ∧ contacts==0 ∧ ¬tipped`. 5 trials is too small for reliability claims; use ≥10.
9. **Supervisor panic = any-button override (real robot).** Any press on the Unitree BT pad latches a 5 s window: auto `cmd_vel` blocked, FAR disarmed, sticks drive directly. See [docs/claude/real_robot.md](docs/claude/real_robot.md#supervisor-panic-override-any-button-emergency).
10. **Any node doing TF lookup in dual-robot setup MUST have `tf_remaps`.** Without `("/tf", f"/{ns}/tf"), ("/tf_static", f"/{ns}/tf_static")`, the node's TF buffer subscribes the global `/tf` (empty in our namespaced setup) and every lookup silently fails — no error log, just stale data or `passthrough_no_tf` status. Discovered the hard way 2026-04-26: path_safety_filter + cmd_vel_safety_shield were inert for hours because of this. **Verify lookups work via `ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo map base_link --ros-args -r /tf:=/{ns}/tf -r /tf_static:=/{ns}/tf_static`**.
11. **CMU's `vehicle` frame is NOT in our SLAM tree by default.** CMU only publishes `sensor → vehicle` (static); `sensor` itself isn't connected to `map` (we have `map → sensor_at_scan`, not `sensor`). So `lookup_transform(map, vehicle)` fails. The mixed launch bridges this with a `base_link → vehicle` static publisher per namespace; nodes reading paths in vehicle frame should also accept a `base_frame_fallback` parameter.
12. **Multi-layer safety stacks deadlock easily.** CFPA2 pivot-lock (refuses goal change) + cmd_vel shield (kills ω) + path_safety_filter (rejects path) can all latch a robot in place if held goal demands rotation it can't execute. Always provide a max-hold/timeout escape valve (e.g. `pivot_lock_max_hold_sec`) on each stateful safety layer. Verify each layer's status topic, NOT just the absence of motion — a robot frozen by 3 layers stacked looks identical to "stuck planner" in /nav_status alone.
13. **`peer_pose_stale_sec` must be generous in sim.** sim_time and wall-clock-stamped messages can drift several seconds during startup; a strict 0.3s threshold rejects fresh peer poses → self_filter publishes scans untouched → peer body becomes a permanent imprint in /map. Default 5.0s in dual-robot launches; tighten on real robot only after verifying timestamp alignment.
14. **MPPI's effective rejection radius = `robot_radius` + `collision_margin_distance`.** With `consider_footprint: false` (the default-because-old-comment-said-it-throws), MPPI treats the robot as a circle and adds margin on top. demo3_mixed has 0.425 m corridors; with `robot_radius=0.40 + margin=0.20 = 0.60 m` MPPI permanently rejected forward motion. **Always set `consider_footprint: true` + a polygon `footprint:` on both costmaps**, then drop `collision_margin_distance` to 0.03 m. The "throws at configure" comment was a yaml-parse bug, not a humble-1.1.20 platform bug.
15. **Footprint changes ripple through CFPA2 frontier filters** ([cfpa2_coordinator.yaml](src/collaborative_exploration/cfpa2_collaborative_autonomy/config/cfpa2_coordinator.yaml)). When you tighten footprint, you typically need to *loosen* `cfpa2_frontier_obstacle_clearance_m`, `cfpa2_frontier_unknown_check_radius_m`, and `cfpa2_frontier_min_cluster_area_m2` proportionally, otherwise late-stage exploration falsely declares "complete" with significant unknown remaining. CFPA2 has **no parameter callback** (`add_on_set_parameters_callback` is not registered), so `ros2 param set` only updates the param store; cached `self.cfpa2_*` values stay frozen. Edit yaml + restart the node.
16. **Sim/real share the same TF + odom data path via `fast_lio_tf_adapter`.** This was *not* the case before 2026-04-29: sim relied on `mujoco_odom_bridge` writing GT directly to TF (bypassing the EKF chain), and real had nothing to take over because CHAMP's `state_estimation_node` outputs `7.8e+34` NaN that starves the EKF. Now [`scripts/runtime/fast_lio_tf_adapter.py`](scripts/runtime/fast_lio_tf_adapter.py) is the single owner of `odom → base_link` TF and `/<ns>/odom/nav` topic, sourced from Fast-LIO's `/<ns>/Odometry`. **`mujoco_odom_bridge.publish_tf` must stay `false`** (or it competes with the adapter on the same TF link). Real-bot drops in unchanged; only `bootstrap_from_gt:=false` differs (no GT to align to).
17. **Don't blame the architecture before grepping the upstream.** Half a day was lost mis-locating the wheel brake bug at the router / MPPI / footprint level when the root cause was a 2-line bug in vendored `mujoco_ros2_control` (the VELOCITY actuator branch never updated `last_command`, so once the controller commanded 0 once, ctrl was never refreshed and stayed at the previous setpoint). When data clearly shows a chain breaking and "everyone says they're publishing the right thing", stop tuning higher layers and read the lowest layer's source.
18. **Outer-loop stuck recovery is needed because MPPI/DWB/FAR rarely *report* failure.** They emit (v ≈ 0, ω ≈ 0) and self-report happy. Nav2's BT recovery only fires on a controller-reported failure → never triggers in this scenario. [`scripts/runtime/stuck_watchdog.py`](scripts/runtime/stuck_watchdog.py) is the watchdog: 10 s no-motion + active goal → Nav2 BackUp action → republish goal. Per-namespace, real-robot-compatible. Caveat: BackUp itself collision-checks `simulate_ahead_time × backup_speed` of clearance (≈ 0.20 m), so a robot wedged between two walls still fails recovery — last-resort raw-cmd_vel pulse not yet wired.

## Communication style

- Fast and direct. Short questions expect immediate, precise answers.
- Show work but don't narrate it. Run commands, make changes, report what happened.
- When told "still not working", don't repeat the same fix — go deeper.
- Respect the maintainer's hypotheses. When they say "I AM certain it's due to X", treat as strong signal; validate or disprove with evidence, not conjecture.

## Environment

- Python 3.10 (micromamba `cmu_env`)
- ROS 2 Humble (`/opt/ros/humble/`)
- Build: colcon + ament_cmake / ament_python
- DDS: FastDDS (sim), CycloneDDS (real robot)
- Sim: MuJoCo 3.6.0 (pip) + DFKI mujoco_ros2_control
- VLM API: xAI Grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning, key in `.env.xai`
