/**
 * @class MujocoRos2Control
 * @brief Implements a ROS 2 control plugin for controlling a Mujoco robot model.
 *
 * The MujocoRos2Control class is a ROS 2 control plugin that provides integration between the Mujoco physics engine
 * and the ROS 2 control framework. It enables control of a Mujoco robot model using ROS 2 controllers and interfaces.
 *
 * This class handles the initialization of the Mujoco model, the controller manager, and the hardware interfaces. It
 * also manages the simulation loop, where the controllers are updated and the robot state is synchronized with the
 * Mujoco model.
 *
 * To use this plugin, it is necessary to provide the path to the Mujoco XML model file and the path to the ROS 2 control
 * parameters file. The plugin initializes the Mujoco model, creates the necessary hardware interfaces, loads the
 * controllers, and starts the simulation loop.
 *
 * The plugin supports real-time factor control to ensure that the simulation runs at the desired speed. It publishes
 * the simulation time as a ROS 2 clock message and provides access to the current time for synchronization with other
 * components.
 *
 * The MujocoRos2Control class is designed to be instantiated as a ROS 2 node, and it can be easily integrated into a
 * ROS 2 control system for controlling a Mujoco robot model.
 *
 * @note This class assumes that the necessary ROS 2 parameters, such as the robot model path, simulation frequency,
 * and controller update rate, are properly set before initialization.
